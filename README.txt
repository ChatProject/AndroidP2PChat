This is a peer to peer chat application.

It connects to a webserver to update information about the user and get information about friends.

The peers currently communicate by sending and receiving instances of The Data class using
ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream classes.

The friends list is received from the webserver in the form on JSON.

There is currently no user authentication.
